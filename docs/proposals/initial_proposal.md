## Bringing artificial intelligence to bear on the improvement of human cognitive skills (draft)

**Christopher Beitel, Ph.D. (@cwbeitel)**


### Abstract

How can we use recent advances in artificial intelligence to enhance human cognitive abilities? We first declare our goal to be to enhance executive function, define its measurable constructs, and dive into a mechanistic exploration of the brain structures that give rise to these faculties. Next we make the argument that these faculties are trainable by surveying the efficacy of both modern and millennia-old games of cognitive training. We then ask what modalities of information are available to us to feed to an AI system that could enhance one’s progression through a cognitive training game (of many potential forms). Building on this foundation, we discuss in detail a machine learning strategy, both in terms of prior work and fascinating new directions. We close with a practical strategic discussion of the people and organizational structures needed to make this vision a success.
